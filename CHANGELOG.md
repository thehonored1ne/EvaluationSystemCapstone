## [Unreleased]

---

## [2026-06-13]

### Added
- **Evaluation Schedule Removal Protection**: Enforced backend and UI safeguards preventing administrators from clearing or removing evaluation schedules while evaluations are active/open.
- **AI Sentiment Analysis Pipeline**: Implemented a Python Flask API serving VADER sentiment analysis (with Tagalog/Taglish custom lexicon) and a Decision Tree Classifier using TF-IDF feature extraction. Integrated with Laravel queue jobs and database storage via Eloquent models, and added a CLI command `php artisan ai:train` for classification training and historical data backfilling.
- **Automated AI Retraining Schedule**: Configured the `ai:train` command to run automatically daily at midnight via Laravel's console scheduler to continually retrain the classification model on newly submitted reviews.

### Changed
- **AI Port Migration**: Migrated the Python Flask API port from `5000` to `5001` across the Flask app, Laravel CLI training command, queue jobs, and integration tests to resolve port binding conflicts with Windows System services (PID 4).

### Fixed
- **IDE Python Path Resolution**: Configured `.vscode/settings.json`, `pyrightconfig.json`, and `pyproject.toml` settings at both the workspace root and the `python/` directory level to map the Python interpreter and extra paths to the project virtual environment, resolving IDE "Cannot find module" errors.
- **Python Type Warning**: Removed an unnecessary `float()` cast around the `vader_score` variable inside `python/app.py`.

### Security
- **Dependency Vulnerability Fixes**: Added an `overrides` configuration block in `package.json` to lock `esbuild` to `^0.28.1` (resolving `GHSA-gv7w-rqvm-qjhr` RCE vulnerability), eliminating all 4 remaining high-severity audit vulnerabilities without forcing a breaking upgrade of `vite` to version 8.

## [2026-06-10]

### Added
- **Transactional Account Deletion**: Enabled secure database-transactional user account deletions for Deans, Program Heads, Faculty, Staff, and Students via the Admin portal.
- **Advanced User Filters**: Added a "None" option to Department filters (for fast sorting) and added Program and Year Level filters on the Students page.
- **Searchable Select Element**: Built a custom, Alpine.js-powered `<x-searchable-select>` component to replace standard HTML select dropdowns in large-list views (e.g., reports, student management, and classes).
- **Destructive Action Confirmation Modals**: Deployed a reusable `<x-confirmation-modal>` component displaying deletion targets and cascading warnings across all destructive admin actions.

### Fixed
- **Persistent Sidebar Badge Count**: Fixed an issue where the notifications badge count remained active in the sidebar by capping dynamic notification timestamps to clear instantly upon landing on the notifications page.

## [2026-06-04]

### Added
- **Subject & Class CRUD**: Built single-file Livewire Volt pages for CRUD operations on Subjects and Classes (with scrollable student enrollments).
- **Dashboard Tab Routing**: Added URL-bound tab routing for Dean and Program Head dashboards to persist active state across page reloads.
- **Schedule Window Modals**: Added overlap confirmation and removal protection modals for scheduling active evaluation windows.

### Changed
- **Sidebar Reorganization**: Replaced flat "Manage Evaluations" with a collapsible "My Evaluations" dropdown menu for evaluator roles.
- **Timezone Alignment**: Configured default application timezone to `Asia/Manila` to ensure evaluation windows sync precisely with local server time.

### Added
- **Profanity toast animations**: Built custom CSS shake animations for the constructive profanity warning filter.

### Fixed
- **Livewire DOM Collision**: Fixed rating button collisions (1–5 scale buttons) by implementing Alpine.js rating button state handler.
